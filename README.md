This is my first GUI application written with C++ and wxWidgets.

### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS  

To build, you need to be installed [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) on your platform. After installation you should give the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/usithadev/firstwx

$ cd firstwx

$ cmake -S . -B ./build -G "Unix Makefiles"

$ cd build

$ cmake --build .
```  

Now you can run the FirstWX.exe in the build folder. :)
